        As I reflect back on my schooling and teenage years I remember with clarity how confusing, 
        isolating and anxiety filled they were. Self doubt filled every day and despite what others 
        said, I doubted my every word and action. I remember having anxiety, feeling overwhelmed and 
        lacking confidence - and from what I see it has only become more challenging for them.<br><br>
        The journey through these years requires confidence, clarity and courage. When Anxiety and 
        Stress take over your child's life it leaves them feeling isolated, overwhelmed and lacking 
        the energy and confidence to do anything. Hypnosis & Nero Linguistic Programming (NLP) creates 
        lasting change in a calm and positive way. It allows your child to move beyond the anger, hurt, 
        sadness and confusion of past events and develop the skills and knowledge to become more confident 
        in themselves and to live each day with the clarity and courage to forge their unique paths.
