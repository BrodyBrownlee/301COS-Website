    <h1> Anxiety & Stress are preventing us from living our best life.</h1>
<p>
Our teenagers are experiencing anxiety at levels and frequencies that have never been seen before.  It is preventing them from having the confidence, motivation and energy to try new things, taking part in events or activities that are part of their journey to adult hood. 
<br><br><br>
 Our children are often so worried about looking silly or not getting something right that the mere thought of going to school or trying a new sport or activity is so stressful that they don’t want to do it. There exposure to stress and content above their understanding can lead them to feel very overwhelmed and confused.
<br><br><br>
Hypnotherapy is a gentle, imaginative and relaxing way to work through all those emotions and feelings in a safe environment.  Children often find the imaginative stories, discussions and activities fun.  
<br><br><br>
Teenagers find the non-intrusive approach of hypnotherapy a great way to work through their anxiety and overwhelming emotions in a non confrontational and creative way. 
<br><br><br>
Hypnotherapy is NOT what you see on TV or YouTube there is no stage - just a chair (or beanbag ) to sit back in and a safe space to relax.
<br><br><br>
Your child deserves to be able to live their best life…
<br><br>
Warm Regards
