         Quit Smoking For Good…
         <br><br>  
         Smoking causes the premature death of 1000's of New Zealanders every year, and destroys the health of 1000's more.
         <br><br>
         Despite the well known dangers of smoking cigarettes people continue to smoke. Some people will justify their smoking as a way to relax, to curb their appetite or to disassociate themselves from the stress and worries of the day.
