        <h3>WHAT IS HYPNOSIS?</h3>

Hypnosis induces a trance-like state of focus and concentration â€“ similar to when you are deep in thought or totally absorbed in a moment (book, music, landscape).  
<br><br>
During hypnosis you will enjoy being in a highly relaxed state. 
<br><br>
Hypnosis allows you to access the natural & powerful personal resources that you hold in your subconscious, it is while you are in this state that you are able to replace old automatic responses with new and more desirable ones. Which means that you can overcome barriers and problems of the past so that you can change habits, thoughts and behaviors that no longer work for you.
<br><br>
<h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>

One way is through mental imagery which is a great tool for creating lasting change. Your mind is capable of using this imagery to move you towards your goals. Athletes do this all the time, they constantly focus on the outcome they desire and do this with intense clarity and focus. Children also do this naturally and are often in trance like state as they engage in imaginary play.
<br><br>
Suggestion is another hypnotic method.  Because you are in a state of deep concentration and focus, ideas and suggestions that align with your goals are able to make a powerful impact on your subconscious. 
<br><br>
Hypnosis can also be used to identify and understand underlying beliefs, events or experiences from the past that maybe causing you problems today. As mentioned, by bypassing the interference and the ever-critical conscious mind, a space is opened up for you to allow change to take place.
<br><br>
<h3>WHAT HYPNOSIS IS NOT</h3>

It is <strong>not</strong> like you see at the shows!  
<br><br>
You will never be unconscious or asleep or in any way out of control.  No one can ever make you do anything against your will or make you reveal information that you do not want to share.  The therapists may make suggestions, but you always have the free will to decide whether you act on them or not, which means you are always in control.
<br><br>
<h3>DOES HYPNOSIS WORK?</h3>

YES! 
<br><br>
It is true that some people are more responsive to hypnosis than others and benefit more readily than others. However, as with any goals we have to improve our health and well-being you have to be highly motivated and committed to achieve your desired outcomes.
