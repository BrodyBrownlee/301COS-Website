            <h2>A Confident You</h2>
             Self Esteem is believing that no matter what happens good or bad that you can handle it -that you will be okay?  
            <br><br>
            It is knowing that if it doesn’t work out that you have the internal resources and support networks to pick you back up, pop you back on your feet and hold you steady till you get yourself ready to have another go.
            <br><br>
            We believed when we were babies that we had the ability to do anything! We learnt to sit, crawl, walk and talk! We knew instinctively to kept trying.  There was no concept of failure, there was only an internal commitment to keep going until we succeeded. 
            <br><br>
            Over time we began to compare ourselves to others, we started to give others opinions and thoughts priority above our own and our self esteem and confidence was handed over to ‘others’.  
            <br><br>
            As our self esteem lowers it only makes sense that our confidence does too.  Confidence is how we rate our ability to perform a task like playing sport, taking a test or in social settings.  We may feel confident riding a bike, or writing a fantastic essay and we do it with a calm and relaxed state of mind, but if we are put in a position where we have to do something new we become plagued with self-doubt and negative self-talk.  
            <br><br><br>
            <u><strong>Becoming Confident</u></strong>
            <br><br>
            Now the only difference between a confident person from one who is not is BELIEF – the belief that you can! We ALL have that little voice in our head, and I promise you it its either your best friend or your worst enemy!  
            <br><br>
            Self-talk can either lift you up or sink you before you begin, and the crazy thing is the talk starts before you have even tried…so how do you now with CERTAINTY that the negative voice is correct? You don’t! Just because its louder and talks more doesn’t make it right! Remember that really loud kid in class?  Where they always right? Nope!
            <br><br>
            Honestly, if you are going to listen to the voices in your head, it is WAY more fun listening to a voice that tells you that YOU CAN DO IT!
            <br><br>
            Remember confidence isn’t about succeeding the first time or being the best, confidence is a willingness to try and to give it  a go. 
            <br><br><br>
            <u><strong>Confident Tips:</u></strong>
            <br><br>
            We don’t fail because we try something new, we fail because we don’t try. We are always in a state of learning; this is how we grow. Growth is progress!
            <br><br>
             Choose something small to begin with.  Do it with a friend or maybe someone in your family – it’s great having an accountability buddy and someone to talk through the challenges with.
            <br><br>
            Celebrate along the way.  If your goal was to run 5km, celebrate your first 1km, then your 2km etc.
            <br><br>
            Have a plan so that if you start to feel nervous or that silly voice in your head starts talking you have someone to chat to about it. Hint: I always make that negative voice sound like a Chipmunk!! Hard to take it seriously then!
            <br><br>
            Be patient.  You would never growl a baby for falling down when it was trying to walk – don’t growl at yourself for not getting it right the first (or 2nd, or 3rd or 4th……time).
            <br><br>
            It doesn’t have to be perfect!  Perfect doesn’t exist – as Nike say Just Do It!
            <br><br>
            Find your Passion – learn or do something that makes you really excited!
            <br><br>
            Confidence comes from the ability to move from thought into action.  Don’t overthink it. Don’t try and make it perfect first…just start!  Have your support team ready, your plan in place and Do IT!
            <br><br>
            Success is a habit born from action…take action NOW!
            <br><br>
             I believe in YOU!
