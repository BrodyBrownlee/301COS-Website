 <strong>Phobias</strong> can be frightening and incredibly debilitating often restricting our children from living their lives fully. For many years, severe anxiety-based conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder or phobias were considered treatable only through long, painful exposure therapy, and in some cases, not at all.
 <br><br>
 Now, thankfully, we have access to a more comfortable, relaxed and effective treatment that can greatly reduce, and even remove, phobic symptoms quickly.  
 <br><br>
 <strong>Nocturnal Enuresis </strong> (Bedwetting) can be embarrassing for children and stressful for parents and caregivers.  Hypnotherapy works by helping to get the brain and bladder to communicate more effectively so that when your childs bladder gets full, it clearly sends a message to their brain to wake your child up. This is a relaxing and fun process in which a parent is present and is done over 3-4 sessions.  
 <br><br>
 <strong>Anxiety </strong>can be a normal and inevitable part of life. For teenagers however living  in a state of anxiousness and overwhelm effects their learning, friendships, family and their future. It greatly reduces their ability to enjoy life. Hypnotherapy is an amazing resource that taps into the power of the mind. It will allow an improved quality of thinking, feeling and choices, and enhance the quality of their life.
 <br><br>
 <strong>Unwanted Habits (nail biting, thumb sucking)</strong>
 <br><br>
 Children often develop ways to soothe or self settle and many children move on from these in their own time. However some children find it more challenging and over time find themselves left with a habit that can be challenging to let go of.  
 <br><br>
 The hypnosis sessions uses specific visualisation techniques, metaphors and activities that give them new strategies, new understanding and the confidence to leave the unwanted behavior behind them.
